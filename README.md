#This is code for FRC team 4910, East Cobb Robotics, 2017 practice robot.

The libraries needed to run this code include:
SF2 (Sensor Fusion Framework) - Direct link: http://www.kauailabs.com/public_files/sf2/sf2.zip - Chief Delphi page: https://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?t=152956
NavX (AHRS 9 axis sensor) - Direct link: http://www.kauailabs.com/public_files/navx-mxp/navx-mxp.zip - Chief Delphi page: https://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?t=131859 (also mentioned above)
opencsv-3.8 (CSV helper) - Sourceforge link: https://sourceforge.net/projects/opencsv/files/opencsv/3.8/
CTRLib (CANTalon libraries) - Indirect link: http://www.ctr-electronics.com/hro.html#product_tabs_technical_resources (under latest installer)

Both the SF2 and NavX libraries are automatically added to the wpilib/user/libs folder on installation. The CANTalon libraries are so large because CTR packed the Hero board libraries in with the rest of the installer.
